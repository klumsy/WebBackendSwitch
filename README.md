# Multi-Service Microservices Application Framework

A production-ready, security-focused microservices framework demonstrating modern architectural patterns and best practices in distributed systems design.

## üî¨ Research Project Overview

This project was created as a comprehensive research initiative to explore and demonstrate:
1. Using AI agents (specifically Replit) to architect and build complex, multi-layer applications
2. Implementing proper separation of concerns across different technology stacks
3. Integrating comprehensive testing strategies across all layers
4. Analyzing security implications and best practices in microservices
5. Documenting the development process and architectural decisions

The goal was to create a real-world example of how AI-assisted development can handle complex architectural decisions, security considerations, and testing requirements while maintaining code quality and proper separation of concerns.

## Why This Project?

This framework was created to demonstrate how to:
1. Build scalable microservices with proper separation of concerns
2. Implement secure service-to-service communication
3. Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging
4. Maintain data consistency across distributed services

## üèó Architecture

### Service Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
  - State Management: React Query
  - Routing: wouter
  - UI Components: shadcn/ui
- **Backend Services**:
  - Service A (User Management): Python Flask
  - Service B (Post Management): TypeScript/Node.js
  - Service C (Calculator): .NET Core
- **Database**: SQLite with:
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy (Service A)
  - Drizzle ORM (Service B)
- **API Layer**:
  - REST endpoints
  - GraphQL gateway (planned)

For detailed architecture information, see [Technical Architecture](./README2.MD).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SQLite 3

### Development Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-service-app.git
   cd multi-service-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install              # Frontend and Service B dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Service A dependencies
   dotnet restore          # Service C dependencies
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure required environment variables (see [Environment Setup](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md))

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Environment Setup](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md).

## üß™ Testing

### Test Coverage
- Service A: pytest (90%+ coverage)
- Service B: Jest (85%+ coverage)
