# Multi-Service Microservices Application Framework

A production-ready, security-focused microservices framework demonstrating modern architectural patterns and best practices in distributed systems design.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases a robust implementation of microservices architecture, focusing on:
- Secure inter-service communication
- Flexible system architecture
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Production-ready security measures

### Why This Project?

This framework was created to demonstrate how to:
1. Build scalable microservices with proper separation of concerns
2. Implement secure service-to-service communication
3. Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging
4. Maintain data consistency across distributed services

## üèó Architecture

### Service Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
  - State Management: React Query
  - Routing: wouter
  - UI Components: shadcn/ui
- **Backend Services**:
  - Service A (User Management): Python Flask
  - Service B (Post Management): TypeScript/Node.js
  - Service C (Calculator): .NET Core
- **Database**: SQLite with:
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy (Service A)
  - Drizzle ORM (Service B)
- **API Layer**:
  - REST endpoints
  - GraphQL gateway (planned)

For detailed architecture information, see [Technical Architecture](./README2.MD).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x
- Python 3.11
- .NET Core 7.0
- SQLite 3

### Development Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-service-app.git
   cd multi-service-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install              # Frontend and Service B dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Service A dependencies
   dotnet restore          # Service C dependencies
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure required environment variables (see [Environment Setup](#environment-setup))

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Development Guidelines](./PRD2.MD).

## üß™ Testing

### Test Coverage
- Service A: pytest (90%+ coverage)
- Service B: Jest (85%+ coverage)
- Service C: xUnit (85%+ coverage)
- Frontend: React Testing Library

### Running Tests
```bash
# Service A
cd services/service_a
pytest

# Service B
cd services/service-b
npm test

# Service C
cd services/service-c
dotnet test

# Frontend
npm run test
```
