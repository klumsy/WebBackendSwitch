# Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive security analysis of the multi-service web application, examining potential vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and security risks across all components of the technology stack.

## Critical Security Risks
1. **[SEVERE] Unprotected Internal API Keys**
   - Current Implementation: Internal API keys are passed through headers without additional protection
   - Attack Vector: Network sniffing could expose internal API keys
   - Impact: Complete system compromise
   - Mitigation Required: Implement encrypted communication channels and key rotation

2. **[SEVERE] Insecure Session Management**
   - Current Implementation: Using `memorystore` for session storage in production
   - Attack Vector: Memory leaks and session hijacking
   - Impact: User impersonation and data breach
   - Mitigation Required: Replace with secure session store (Redis/PostgreSQL)

3. **[HIGH] Missing Rate Limiting**
   - Current Implementation: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Attack Vector: Brute force attacks on login
   - Impact: Account compromise
   - Mitigation Required: Implement rate limiting on all authentication endpoints

## Component Security Analysis

### 1. Authentication System
#### Threats
- Password brute force attacks
- Session hijacking
- Token theft
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

#### Current Implementation Issues
```typescript
// Current Session Configuration (server/routes.ts)
app.use(
  session({
    store: new MemoryStore({ // SECURITY RISK: Not suitable for production
      checkPeriod: 86400000
    }),
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      httpOnly: true,
      maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
    }
  })
);
```

#### Risk Assessment
- Session Management: HIGH RISK
  - In-memory session storage is vulnerable to memory leaks
  - No session fixation protection
  - Missing secure flag in development

### 2. Database Security
#### Threats
- SQL injection
- Unauthorized access
- Data leakage
- Schema exposure

#### Current Implementation Issues
```python
# Service A (models.py)
@staticmethod
def create(username: str, email: str, password: str) -> 'User':
    # SECURITY RISK: No input validation before database operations
    return User(username=username, email=email, password=password)
```

#### Risk Assessment
- SQL Injection: MEDIUM RISK
  - ORM usage provides basic protection
  - Missing input validation in some endpoints
  - No prepared statement enforcement

### 3. API Security
#### Threats
- CSRF attacks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Parameter tampering
- API abuse

#### Current Implementation Issues
```typescript
// Missing CSRF Protection
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  // SECURITY RISK: No CSRF token validation
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // ... user creation logic
});
```

#### Risk Assessment
- CSRF Protection: HIGH RISK
  - Missing CSRF tokens in forms
  - No validation on state-changing endpoints
  - Cross-origin requests not properly restricted

### 4. Inter-service Communication
#### Threats
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Service impersonation
- Message tampering
- Unauthorized service access

#### Current Implementation Issues
```typescript
// Internal API calls (service-b)
const verifyUser = async (userId: number) => {
  // SECURITY RISK: Plain HTTP communication between services
  const response = await fetch(
    `${SERVICE_A_URL}/internal/verify/${userId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        'X-Internal-API-Key': INTERNAL_API_KEY // Transmitted in plain text
      }
    }
  );
  return response.ok;
};
```

#### Risk Assessment
- Service Authentication: SEVERE RISK
  - Plain text API keys in headers
  - No mutual TLS authentication
  - Missing message signing

### 5. Frontend Security
#### Threats
- XSS attacks
- Client-side injection
- Sensitive data exposure
- DOM manipulation

#### Current Implementation Issues
```typescript
// React Query Implementation
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['/api/users'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    // SECURITY RISK: No data sanitization before rendering
    const response = await fetch('/api/users');
    return response.json();
  }
});
```

#### Risk Assessment
- XSS Protection: MEDIUM RISK
  - React provides basic XSS protection
  - Missing content security policy
  - Insufficient data sanitization

### 6. Dependency Security
#### Threats
- Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Supply chain attacks
- Malicious package injection
- Outdated dependencies

#### Current Implementation Issues
- Multiple outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- No automated security updates
- Missing dependency audit in CI/CD

#### Risk Assessment
- Dependency Management: HIGH RISK
  - Several outdated packages
  - No automated vulnerability scanning
  - Missing dependency lockfiles
