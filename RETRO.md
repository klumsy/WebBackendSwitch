# Project Retrospective

## What Went Well

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Microservices Separation**: Clear boundaries between services helped maintain code organization
2. **Technology Choices**: Using different technologies for each service demonstrated polyglot architecture
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized routing and service discovery simplified frontend integration

### Implementation Achievements
1. **Cross-Service Communication**: Successfully implemented protected internal APIs
2. **Database Integration**: Each service maintains its own data store
3. **Frontend Integration**: Clean React implementation with modern tooling

## Challenges Faced

### Service Integration
1. **Initial Setup**: Coordinating multiple services was complex
2. **CORS Configuration**: Required multiple iterations to get right
3. **Service Discovery**: Had to implement proper routing in Express gateway

### Development Process
1. **Testing Strategy**: Took too long to implement proper testing
2. **Database Choices**: Initially started with PostgreSQL, switched to SQLite for simplicity
3. **TypeScript Configuration**: Had some issues with type definitions

## Areas for Improvement

### Agent Implementation
1. **Earlier Testing**: Should have implemented testing framework from the start
2. **Better Error Handling**: Could have implemented more robust error handling earlier
3. **Documentation**: Should have maintained documentation throughout development

### Technical Decisions
1. **Database Choice**: Could have started with SQLite instead of switching later
2. **Type Safety**: Could have enforced stricter TypeScript configurations
3. **Service Communication**: Could have implemented GraphQL earlier

## Lessons Learned

### Agent Perspective
1. **Planning**: Need better upfront planning for multi-service applications
2. **Testing**: Should prioritize testing setup earlier in development
3. **Documentation**: Should maintain documentation alongside development
4. **Error Handling**: Need more comprehensive error handling strategy

### User Interaction
1. **Requirements Clarification**: Could have asked for more detailed requirements initially
2. **Feedback Loops**: Could have established shorter feedback cycles
3. **Progress Updates**: Could have provided more frequent status updates

### Technical Insights
1. **Service Communication**: Internal API pattern worked well but needed better documentation
2. **Database Choices**: Simpler solutions (SQLite) can be better for development
3. **Frontend Architecture**: React Query proved to be a good choice for state management

## Recommendations for Future Projects

### For the Agent
1. Start with a comprehensive project structure
2. Implement testing framework early
3. Maintain documentation throughout development
4. Establish clear error handling patterns
5. Focus on type safety from the start

### For the Prompter
1. Provide detailed requirements upfront
2. Establish clear acceptance criteria
3. Define priority of features
4. Specify preferred testing approach
5. Indicate performance expectations

### Technical Recommendations
1. Start with simpler database solutions
2. Implement proper logging from the start
3. Use type-safe approaches consistently
4. Plan service communication patterns early
5. Set up proper development workflows initially

## Conclusion
While the project successfully met its requirements, earlier focus on testing, documentation, and error handling would have made the development process smoother. Future projects should prioritize these aspects from the start and maintain clearer communication between agent and prompter.
